This repo is used for Data Mining - Assignment 2: *Apriori* algorithm.

The file contains 4 components:

1. Data: vote.arff and test.arff
2. Python file: determine frequent sets and generate association rules
- **Apriori_algorithm_vote_data.ipynb:** is used for "vote.arff" dataset
- **Apriori_algorithn.py:** assignment submission.

3. Plots: the runtime of algorithm and the number of rules as a function of "minimum support"
4. Output: two text files for frequent sets and association rules.
