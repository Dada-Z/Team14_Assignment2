Team member: Dada Zhang, Nick Montemarano

This repo is used for Data Mining - Assignment 2: *Apriori* algorithm.

The file contains 4 components:

1. Data: vote.arff and test.arff

2. Python file: determine frequent sets and generate association rules
- **Apriori_algorithm_vote_data.ipynb:** is used for "vote.arff" dataset
- **apriori_algorithm_team14.py:** assignment submission.
  + !python apriori_algorithm_team14.py

3. Plots: the runtime of algorithm and the number of rules as a function of "minimum support"
- runtime_algorithm.png
- runtime_number_rules.png

4. Output: two text files for frequent sets and association rules.
- frequent_itemsets.txt
- association_rules.txt
